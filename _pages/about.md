I am a PhD student in the [Social AI CDT](https://socialcdt.org/) programme and a member of the [Social AI group](https://www.socialaiglasgow.co.uk/home) at the [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/) under the supervision of [Dr. Tanaya Guha](https://www.tanayag.com) and [Prof. Fahim Kawsar](https://www.fahim-kawsar.net). My research focuses on exploring the therapeutic potential of music to design personalised health interventions. More specifically, I study how music influences emotional states by analysing peripheral physiological signals and uncovering patterns in spontaneous responses to acoustic stimuli across diverse populations. Likewise, I am interested in unravelling the therapeutic properties of music towards the automatic transformation of songs into their therapeutic versions. The ultimate goal is to integrate multimodal sensors and machine learning to create innovative health and well-being applications tailored to individual needs.

Before joining this PhD programme, I worked on projects in public research centres and the tech startup scene in Mexico. As a research assistant at the Centre for Scientific Research and Higher Education in Ensenada, I embarked on my academic journey and delved into diverse areas relevant to Social AI. This included affective computing, computational paralinguistics, machine learning, virtual agents, and interpretable AI. Engaging in these fields helped me develop essential skills in programming, supervised learning, and working with different data modalities.

If you find my work interesting, feel free to reach out! Stay tuned for updates on my project as they unfold.
