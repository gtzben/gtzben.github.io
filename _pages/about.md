I am a PhD student in the [Social AI CDT](https://socialcdt.org/) programme and a member of the [Social AI group](https://www.socialaiglasgow.co.uk/home) at the [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/), working under the supervision of [Dr. Tanaya Guha](https://www.tanayag.com) and [Prof. Fahim Kawsar](https://www.fahim-kawsar.net). My research explores the relationship between music and physiology in everyday life to develop personalised, music-based health interventions. I study how music influences our emotional and physiological responses to inform the generation of adaptive acoustic patterns to moderate arousal levels.

Before joining this PhD programme, I worked on projects in public research centres and the tech startup scene in Mexico. As a research assistant at the Centre for Scientific Research and Higher Education in Ensenada ([CICESE UT3](https://ut3.cicese.mx)), I embarked on my academic journey and delved into diverse areas relevant to Social AI. This included affective computing, computational paralinguistics, machine learning, virtual agents, and interpretable AI. Engaging in these fields helped me develop essential skills in programming, supervised learning, and working with different data modalities.

If you find my work interesting, feel free to reach out! Stay tuned for updates on my project as they unfold.
